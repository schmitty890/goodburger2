This project uses gulp to convert sass files into css files. Additionally, it converts css and javascript files into minified files and uses those minified files on production. Run `gulp` to run all the gulp tasks.

The command `gulp` will automatically launch the project in google chrome.

The files watched by gulp are the client js and sass files.

Client side js files are located at `public/assets/js/*.js`. Editing these files and saving will kick off a gulp build and auto refresh your development workspace.

Sass files are located at `sass/partials/*.scss`. Editing these files and saving will kick off a gulp build and auto refresh your development workspace.
